# Threat-Intelligence
This is a collection of the code that i've been working on for my proof of concept Threat Intelligence tool.
The code will be updated as it is developed but at present there are three python 2.7 scripts that are intended to collect threat intelligence data from sources of data on newly discovered vulnerabilities, phishing campaigns and confirmed malware domains. 

dnscoll.py
phishcoll.py
vulncoll.py

The data is then stored within an sqllite database. 

The next stage of the project is to correlate the open source intelligence gathered with organsational internal telemetry data.
